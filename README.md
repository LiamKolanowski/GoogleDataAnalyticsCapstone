* **This code utilizes SQL compatible with DB Browser for SQLite**

## Code Organization
The SQL cleaning code is organized in a systematic manner, with each file named alphabetically and corresponding to a chronological step in the data cleaning process. For instance, combine_tables.sql contains the code for the initial step, and subsequent files follow the same pattern in chronological order.
